Password-Based AES Encryption Code
As part of Image Stagenography project by: Obada Hattab, Mohammad Majdi and Abdelqader Okasha
Note on Password Hashing and key derivation:
This code implementes the Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2 (PBKDF2), as specified in RFC 2898. - Pseudorandom function used : HMAC-SHA-1
We used a Standalone implementation of HMAC-SHA-1 developed by Bob Liu "Akagi201", GitHub library name: "hmac-sha1". Copyright (c) 2014 Bob Liu
